This tutorial will describe in details how one can make this game in `pyved-engine`.<br>
The tutorial can be divided into the following sections:

- [Game States](game%20states.md)
- [The Game State](game%20state.md)
- [The Score State](score%20state.md)
- [The Home State](home%20state.md)

Make a new folder for your game, and install `pyved-engine` using `pip install pyved-engine`.
